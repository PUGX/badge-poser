## How to create your own Badge

* Go to the [Badge Poser](https://poser.pugx.org) website
* Insert `username/repository`
* Copy the Markdown generated
* Paste into the README.md
* That's it!

## Why a composer badge?

Not only because all the other languages already have it, but having the latest stable release in the readme could save time.
